                    <p>Johannesburg, South Africa's largest city, was established in 1886 due to a gold rush. Its vibrant diversity reflects a mix of ethnic communities and cultures.</p>
                    <p>Historically significant in the anti-apartheid struggle, Johannesburg saw major events like the 1976 Soweto Uprising. In the post-apartheid era, the city has evolved into a major economic hub, known for its dynamic arts scene and cultural landmarks such as the Apartheid Museum. </p>
                    <p>Modern neighborhoods like Maboneng and Braamfontein highlight its innovative spirit, offering a rich blend of cuisines, entertainment, and cultural experiences.</p>
